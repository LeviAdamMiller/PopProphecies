Machine Learning Data Analytics

The purpose of this project is to take the features in the dataset song length, tempo, genre, number of instruments, lyrical content and release year to predict the popularity value of the song. 

The project uses 4 models 

   - Linear Regression
   - Logisitic Regression
   - Decision Regression
   - Random Forest Regression

For every model the data is split into training and testing data, the models are trained on the training data then they get tested on the testing data.

Setup and exexution

I worked on the project locally in vscode in a jupternotebook, I downloaded the jupernote book extension in vscode and connecting to kernal python 3.12.7 through an application called Anaconda Navigator. 

Split the data for training and testing, trained and tested the models visualized the results or visualized the implications of the features.
